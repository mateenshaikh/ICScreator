# ICScreator

# Use
If you want to use the tool, you don't want this page, you want the github.io page: [https://mateenshaikh.github.io/ICScreator](https://mateenshaikh.github.io/ICScreator).

If you want to fork/modify it, it's just the html. Note that it's under a strong copyleft license.

## Holidays and other days
In outlook, you can manually remove skipped events (e.g., one off pre-cancelled class or a whole day because of a holiday) on an individual basis. That's going to be faster than if that functionality was built in this tool.

# Development

This document was created over a half-hour with copilot through a series of prompts to create the ICS file and massage the layout to be more compact.
